Exploratory Analysis of Geolocational Data
(Self-Project)

Project Discription
Experience a day in the life of a Data Scientist/Engineer by doing a full-fledged analysis of
real-life data. Fetch, Clean, Analyse and run K Means Clustering on Geolocational data to
recommend accommodations to immigrants to a city!

Skills Learned:
REST API, K-Means Clustering, Data Preparation, Data Visualisation

Project Stages:
Collect data-> Clean and Visualise data-> Run K-Means Clustering on the data-> Get geolocational data from Foursquare-> Plot the result on Map

High-Level Approach
• Fetch Datasets from the relevant locations (Data Collection)
• Clean the Datasets to prepare them for analysis. (Data Cleaning via Pandas)
• Visualise the data using boxplots. (Using Matplotlib /Seaborn /Pandas)
• Fetch Geolocational Data from the Foursquare API. (REST APIs)
• Use K-Means Clustering to cluster the locations (Using ScikitLearn)
• Present findings on a map. (Using Folium/Seaborn)
